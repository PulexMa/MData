      "description":"Ghost Jump is one of the longest parkour maps you will ever play, and it’s not easy! But luckily, there is a checkpoint on each new level which ensures some safety even if you were to fall down and die. It’s really well designed and includes a great mix of style and challenges. It’s probably going to take somewhere around 30 minutes to complete it for most of you, but that is obviously dependent on your skill level.",
